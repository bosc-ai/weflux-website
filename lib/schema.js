/* =========================================================
   Weflux - JSON-LD structured data

   Generated at build time from one source rather than hand
   written into thirty-one pages, so the Organization entity
   cannot drift between them. build.js calls injectSchema()
   on every page in /dist.

   Deliberately NOT emitted:
   - AggregateRating / Review. We have no verifiable review
     corpus, and inventing one is a manual action risk.
   - Review or rating markup on comparison.html. Self-serving
     markup about competitors violates Google's guidelines.
   - Certification claims on security.html. SOC 2 and ISO 27001
     are asserted in the copy but unverified; marking them up
     would put a machine-readable claim behind them.
   - WebPage on legal pages. It earns no rich result and no
     answer-engine benefit; it is noise.
