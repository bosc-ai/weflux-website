faqs:
  - q: "Will my number get restricted for sending broadcast campaigns?"
    a: "Not for using the official WhatsApp Business API as intended. Bans in waves are what happens to unofficial tools that automate the consumer WhatsApp app, which violates WhatsApp's terms. On the official API the risk is policy-based: message people who did not opt in and blocks and reports lower your quality rating until the number is restricted."
  - q: "Can I recover a banned WhatsApp number?"
    a: "Usually not. You can appeal through Meta, and appeals occasionally succeed where the ban was an error, but a number banned for automating the app is generally gone. This is why the choice of tool matters more than it appears: you are risking an asset your customers already have saved."
  - q: "How many messages can I send per day on the official API?"
    a: "It depends on your messaging limit, which Meta sets per number. New numbers typically start at 250 unique customers per rolling 24 hours and step up through 1,000, 10,000 and 100,000 as you send consistently with a good quality rating."
  - q: "What counts as valid opt-in for WhatsApp?"
    a: "Asking clearly on any channel and keeping a record. A checkout checkbox that says plainly they will receive WhatsApp messages from your business by name, a website form, a click-to-WhatsApp ad, or an in-store sign-up. A purchased list is not opt-in, and neither is a phone number given for delivery."

Many businesses looking to scale their WhatsApp outreach encounter unofficial tools promising unlimited messages from personal or Business App numbers for a one-time fee. They work temporarily. Then the number is banned, and it does not come back.

Here is what is actually going on, and how sending at volume works when you do it properly.

## Why the cheap tools get you banned

Unofficial bulk senders work by automating the WhatsApp app itself, usually by driving WhatsApp Web or running a modified client. This violates WhatsApp's terms of service directly.

Meta detects the pattern rather than the tool. Message velocity that no human produces, identical text to hundreds of recipients, a sudden burst from a number with no conversation history. Enforcement arrives in waves, which is why these tools appear to work for weeks and then a cohort of users is banned on the same day.

The part people underestimate: **the number is usually gone permanently.** Not the tool, the number. The one printed on your packaging, saved in your customers' phones, and on your invoices.

## What the official API does differently

The WhatsApp Business API is Meta's own product for exactly this use case. The trade it asks is specific.

You give up the ability to send arbitrary text to strangers. Any message to someone who has not written to you in the last 24 hours must use a **template approved by Meta in advance**.

In exchange you get a number that keeps working, delivery and read reporting that comes from Meta rather than being guessed at, messaging limits that rise as you demonstrate you are not a nuisance, and eligibility for the verified badge.

| | Official API | Unofficial sender |
|---|---|---|
| Permitted by WhatsApp | Yes | No |
| Risk to your number | Normal policy risk, appealable | Ban in waves, usually permanent |
| First message | Pre-approved template | Anything |
| Volume | Tiered limit that grows | "Unlimited", until it stops |
| Reporting | Delivered, read, failed, from Meta | Sent from the device |
| Verified badge | Possible | No |

## The rules that keep a number healthy

Templates keep you compliant. These keep you welcome, which matters more.

**Message people who actually opted in.** A checkout checkbox naming your business, a website form, a click-to-WhatsApp ad, an in-store sign-up. Record when and how. A phone number given so a parcel could be delivered is not consent to market, and the block rate will tell you so within one campaign.

**Say who you are in the first line.** Most people read the notification preview and nothing else. If they cannot tell who this is, some of them report it, and reports are what Meta counts.

**Segment rather than broadcasting to an unsegmented list.** Sending to everyone is a small withdrawal from your number's health every time. A smaller, better-chosen audience costs less, converts better, and protects the rating.

**Get the template category right.** Marketing content submitted as Utility gets rejected, and repeated attempts affect your account standing.

**Honour opt-outs immediately**, including the informal ones people type as a reply. Someone who said stop and gets another message reports rather than replies.

**Ramp a new number gradually.** Do not take a brand-new number straight to a list of 20,000. Build history first.

## Quality rating and messaging limits

Two numbers govern how much you can send.

Your **quality rating** reflects how recipients react, principally blocks and reports. Your **messaging limit** is how many unique people you can start conversations with per rolling 24 hours: typically 250 to begin with, rising through 1,000, 10,000 and 100,000.

Limits rise on consistent sending with a healthy rating and fall when it drops. The failure mode worth planning around is seasonal: brands send most and segment least during a sale, the rating falls in the highest-revenue week of the year, and the limit follows it down.

Check the rating after every large campaign rather than at the end of the quarter.

## What to do if you are already on an unofficial tool

Move before you are forced to, not after.

1. **Export your contacts now**, while you still have access.
2. **Get a number onto the official API.** Use a different number if you can, so a ban on the old one does not strand you mid-migration.
3. **Write your recurring messages as templates** and get them approved.
4. **Rebuild consent properly.** This is the uncomfortable step. If your list came from a scrape or a purchase, it is not a list, it is a liability, and importing it into a compliant platform makes it a compliant liability.
5. **Ramp slowly** on the new number.

## The short version

You cannot send unlimited, unsolicited WhatsApp messages safely. No tool changes that, and the ones claiming otherwise are borrowing against your number.

What you can do is reach a large opted-in audience reliably, measurably, and without wondering each morning whether the number still works. That is what the official API is for, and the template requirement is the price of it.

More detail in the [broadcasts guide](/broadcasts), and the [message templates guide](/whatsapp-message-templates) covers what gets approved and what does not.
